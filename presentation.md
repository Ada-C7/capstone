# Capstone Presentation
The capstone presentation highlights your application as the culmination of your work at Ada.
It should be __no more than 5 minutes__ in length and should have the following components:

- What problem does the app solve? Who does it solve it for?
- What are 1-2 things you learned?
  - You should focus on what you learned about programming as an art/craft/profession, not what specific technologies you learned to build the app.
  - Example: "I learned that the best way for me to learn is to try a tutorial out and break everything as I go!"
  - Note: "I learned how to Google" -> is not an appropriate learning. Elaborate on that for us!
- What are 1-2 major features of the application, demoed from the eyes of a user? (demo required from *deployed application*)
- Optional: Exciting or interesting technologies you used
- Optional: Future enhancements

Prior to demoing, you should have the following:
- Each group (time blocks on the capstone schedule eventbrite) should coordinate to use two computers for the demos in your group (first 3 or 4 people, and last 3 or 4 people). It would be best to choose one with an HDMI port.
- Dry run at least 2x prior to the demo, in front of someone else
- Know the sequence of events that you will execute to show the features you want to demo
- Prepare slides for any non-app talking points

Recommended:
- Practice your presentation in front of a peer or PM who is not familiar with your app
- Record your demo on your computer to have as a back up in case something happens
